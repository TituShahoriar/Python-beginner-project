%
^
+
5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0
```

## Suggestions and Advice

- You can add more operations to this program by updating the `operations` dictionary with new symbols and their corresponding functions.
- You can also add more features to this program, such as support for more complex expressions or the ability to store and reuse previous results.
- When writing Python code, it's a good idea to follow the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to make your code more readable and consistent.
